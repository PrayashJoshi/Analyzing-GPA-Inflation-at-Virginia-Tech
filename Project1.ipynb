    "* We will split up work evenly among all team members, and work towards common goals that we decide on as a team.\n",
    "* We will communicate consistently with each other over Zoom meetings as well as text and in person meetings. All meetings will be planned and agreed on in the groupchat and each team member will be responsible for showing up and participating during agreed upon meeting times.\n",
    "* In order to work collaboratively on our code, we will be using git lab to share our contributions and a shared Google Drive for documents and brainstorming ideas.\n",
    "* We will implement using the preferred code editor of our choice.\n",
    "* We will use GitLab as our preferred method of collaboration between code.\n",
    "* We will adhere to the team roles assigned to us. The respective team roles are:\n",

    "    * Communicate with them and let them know that they need to participate more.\n",
    "    * Distribute tasks/work to them.\n",
    "    * If the team member misses 3 milestone deliverables without a valid reason, we will contact the professor. \n",
